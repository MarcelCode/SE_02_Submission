    "In computer science there are different ways of solving a problem, for example sorting items in an array. Different algorithms have pros and cons regarding the time and resources efficiency (also called complexity). In this context an algorithm can be described as procedure or a formula to solve a particular problem. The main question is, how we decide which algorithm we should use, when there are multiple solutions to the problem?\n",
